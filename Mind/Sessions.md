## CheckList
# Phase 0 Prepping
1- Kill distractions
```
Phone → out of reach (not silent, not face down  OUT OF REACH)
Browser → only what you need
One tab = one purpose
```
Comfort kills focus.
Slight discomfort sharpens it.

2- Define ONE outcomes

Not “study X or Know Y”.

You write ONE sentence:
```
❌ “Understand X”
❌ “Learn Y”

✅ “Build / solve / explain / fix / replicate / break X”
```
if you dont produce output then you're wasting your time go flip fking burgers

3- Set a Timer

You dont stop when you're bored , dozed off you break off when the timer breaks
if you are studying for more than a couple of hours 25-5 is absloute
