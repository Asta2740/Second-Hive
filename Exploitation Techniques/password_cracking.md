## Types of attacks
Dictionary Attacks -> predefined wordlist / targeted wordlist 

Mask Attack -> incremantation trying every possible way

## Practical tips :

    Start with a wordlist (fast wins). Common lists: rockyou.txt, common-passwords.txt.
    If the wordlist fails, move to targeted wordlists (company names, project names, or data from the target).
    If that fails, try mask or incremental attacks on short passwords (e.g. ?l?l?l?d?d = three lowercase letters + two digits, which is used as a password mask format by password cracking tools).
    Use GPU-accelerated cracking when possible; it dramatically speeds up attacks for some algorithms.
    Keep an eye on resource use: cracking is CPU/GPU intensive. That behaviour can be detected on a monitored endpoint.


## Tools :

    PDF: pdfcrack, john (via pdf2john)
    ZIP: fcrackzip, john (via zip2john)
    General: john (very flexible) and hashcat (GPU acceleration, more advanced)

## pdfcrack
```
pdfcrack -w [wordlist] [pdftobecracked]
```
Opening a pdf

 pdftotext -layout -opw [password] [file] output.txt & type out.txt



## John

so this needs the john bigger tools and you need to extract the Hash then crack it

```
File [the file]

* a zip file

zip2john [file] > hash.txt

john --wordlist=[wordlist] hash.txt

```
```
unzip -p [password] file

7z e [file]
```
