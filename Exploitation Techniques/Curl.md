## Curl 

So HTTP , gives you back some sort of file , lets say an HTML , JS , PDF ,JSON depends on the request 

we can use cURL to Make those requests without the usage of a GUI , we can utilize it to show the Request headers using -i to view potentially hidden headers

So 

-X <The request like POST>
-A <Agent>
-d <Request format like the user and pass>
-c <to save cookies>
-b <to use cookies>
