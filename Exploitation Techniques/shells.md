🛠 Shellcode Learning Roadmap
Phase 1 – Foundations (Day 1–3)
•	Goal: Know the environment where shellcode lives.
1.	Learn/review CPU basics: registers (EAX, EBX, ESP, EIP), stack, memory layout.
2.	Understand system calls: how programs talk to the OS.
3.	Install a lab:
o	Linux VM (e.g., Ubuntu + nasm + gcc + objdump).
o	Optional: Windows VM for later.
________________________________________
Phase 2 – Writing Tiny Assembly (Day 4–7)
•	Goal: Write code that does something small.
1.	Write exit(0) in x86 Linux assembly.
2.	Write write(1, "hi\n", 3) → prints “hi”.
3.	Assemble and run them using nasm + ld.
4.	Disassemble with objdump to see opcodes (raw bytes).
________________________________________
Phase 3 – Shellcode Extraction (Week 2)
•	Goal: Convert assembly → shellcode.
1.	Take your “exit(0)” binary, extract hex bytes.
2.	Embed those bytes into a C program like:
3.	char code[] = "\x31\xc0\xb0\x01\xcd\x80";
4.	int main() { ((void(*)())code)(); }
Run it, and it exits cleanly. 🎉
5.	Understand constraints: null bytes, bad chars.
________________________________________
Phase 4 – Classic Shellcodes (Week 3–4)
•	Goal: Build real, useful shellcodes.
1.	Linux bind shell (listen on port).
2.	Linux reverse shell (connect back).
3.	Learn how syscalls differ on x64 vs x86.
4.	Experiment with polymorphic shellcode (obfuscated but same effect).
________________________________________
Phase 5 – Windows Shellcode (Week 5–6)
•	Goal: Move beyond Linux.
1.	Learn Windows API calling conventions.
2.	Write shellcode that spawns calc.exe.
3.	Explore Metasploit-generated shellcode → disassemble and understand.
________________________________________
Phase 6 – Advanced (Month 2–3)
•	Goal: Think like an attacker, defend like an analyst.
1.	Study encoders (alphanumeric, polymorphic).
2.	Learn about staged shellcode.
3.	Try writing position-independent shellcode.
4.	Read malware samples (tiny ones) and identify their shellcode payloads.
________________________________________
🔑 Rule of thumb:
•	Don’t jump straight into “reverse shell” – start with “exit(0)”.
•	Learn to build, not just copy/paste.
•	Every shellcode is just assembly boiled down to hex.
