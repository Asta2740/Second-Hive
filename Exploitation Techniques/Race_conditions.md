## Race Conditions

so race conditions happen when a system proccess a request that is either shared , multiple users have access to it , or in an automated process , and none of those process have a final validation check to see if the shared or used resources current state before updating it leading up to duplicate entries 

## mitigations

1- check the the Database before the final validation
2- atomic data base , either everything is updated or nothing , everything happen in 1 swip of dedcution and update
