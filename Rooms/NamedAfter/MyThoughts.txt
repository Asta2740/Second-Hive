So this is sort of a new one but i am just putting my thoughts in words

so now i was able to get the password from the fakebook OSINT enumration , but now 
i'm stuck at the second code i couldn't find anything related
i tried to check for the whole thing but couldn't find any 

i notcied that the third code will be related to the port 9001 but we will 
leave it for now , a though came to check the cameras
but when i do check them the server still returns the guard 
so i need something that will make me return the admin

i will look at the html for 8080 right now to see if there is anything that's worth seeing here or notcieda\

ah ya note we could just escape the whole login and getting the first flag by just unhiding the map
since it uses html to hide it with some session check to maintain it but anyways lets do one more check

so nothing new found and no hints regarding the code
my guess its in the video facility but my problem is i can log in with the guardb
but i am having trouble with the admin as when i go there it still gives me guard details not admin 

mmmm maybe there is a clue somewhere let me go check that video portal once again at port 13400


so the video has a osychward exit probably it contains the code but it kinda gives a fake video since the role is server based

soooo how can i move from here 

the thing is that i just noticed the site is different lets try to see what do we have here
