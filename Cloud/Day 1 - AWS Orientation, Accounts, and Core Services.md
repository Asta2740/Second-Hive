# Day 1 - AWS Orientation, Accounts, and Core Services

## Summary of Day 1: Achievements

You successfully completed all three tasks for Day 1, setting a solid foundation for learning AWS. Here’s what you accomplished:

### Task 1: Research Cloud Platforms

You researched AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

### Findings

AWS leads with 32% market share and offers the most job opportunities, making it a strong choice for your career goals.

Azure and GCP are growing, but AWS stands out with its large community, free resources, and over 200 services.

You discovered learning tools like AWS Skill Builder, which will support your studies.

**Takeaway:** AWS is your focus due to its dominance and resources—perfect for aspiring infrastructure engineers like yourself!

### Task 2: Create an AWS Account

You signed up for an AWS free tier account and added billing details.

This gave you access to the AWS Management Console, your hub for exploring AWS services.

You kept it simple and didn’t go beyond setup, which was exactly what the task required.

**Takeaway:** You now have a hands-on environment to experiment with AWS—nice work!

### Task 3: Watch an AWS Introduction Video

You watched an introductory video (link) that covered:

The definition of cloud computing.

AWS global infrastructure: regions, availability zones, edge locations, wavelengths, local zones, and Outpost racks.

### An overview of core AWS services like

EC2: Virtual machines (VMs).

EBS: Disk storage.

RDS: Relational databases.

S3: External/object storage.

A fictional social media platform example, showing how AWS services replace traditional on-premises infrastructure (e.g., EC2 for VMs, S3 for storage).

**Takeaway:** You gained a clear understanding of AWS’s structure and how its services apply to real-world scenarios.

## Notes from Day 1

Here are the key points you picked up today, organized for quick reference:

### Cloud Platforms

AWS: 32% market share, top for jobs, 200+ services, strong community, and resources like AWS Skill Builder.

Azure and GCP: Rising but trail AWS in market share and job prospects.

### AWS Account

Free tier account created with billing set up—your entry point to hands-on learning.

### AWS Infrastructure

Regions: Geographic areas hosting AWS data centers.

Availability Zones: Isolated data centers within regions for reliability.

Edge Locations: Points for content delivery (e.g., via CloudFront).

Additional terms: Wavelengths, Local Zones, Outpost racks—advanced infrastructure options.

### Core Services

EC2: Virtual servers in the cloud (think rentable computers).

EBS: Block storage (like hard drives for EC2).

RDS: Managed relational databases.

S3: Object storage for files, images, etc.

These replace on-premises hardware (e.g., servers, disks, storage arrays).

### Practical Example

The video’s social media platform showed how AWS services (EC2, EBS, RDS, S3) map to traditional infrastructure, making the concepts relatable.

Your notes reflect a solid grasp of AWS’s market position, infrastructure, and key services—great foundation for what’s next!
