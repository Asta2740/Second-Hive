# Day 18 - Serverless App Planning with Amplify

## Key Points

It seems likely that you’ve made progress on your serverless application, focusing onAWS Amplify and GitHub for deployment, but didn’t finish due to time constraints.

Research suggests continuing hands-on tasks to build practical skills, aligning with your infrastructure engineering goals, before moving to security engineering.

The evidence leans toward completing your portfolio site today and planning a week of advanced serverless and security tasks.

## Summary of Work Done

On March 27, 2025, you researched components for a serverless application, including Lambda, API Gateway, RDS/DynamoDB, S3, and CloudFront. You started building a portfolio site usingAWS Amplify, connecting it to GitHub, but didn’t finish.

On March 28, 2025, you went out with friends and couldn’t work on it, planning to continue today, March 29, 2025.

## Important Notes

Amplify and GitHub: Using Amplify for continuous deployment is a great choice for hosting static sites, with features like automatic HTTPS and CI/CD pipelines. Ensure your GitHub repo is set up correctly for deployment.

Cost Awareness: Stay within the free tier; Amplify hosting is typically $0.50/mo within free limits, but monitor usage to avoid charges.

Security: For a public site, consider basic security like IAM roles and WAF later, but for now, focus on getting it live.
