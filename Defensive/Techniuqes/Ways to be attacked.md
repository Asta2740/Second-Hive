## Humans

they're attacked through social engineering , using their psychology to attack the system without them knowing , by phishing email , malware delivery utilizing their brain against them

# Protection

We protect them by blocking phishing traffic before it reaches them
Teach them how to identify malware and malicious websites
and give them an awarness training on security and attack vectors


## systems

We got Vulerabilities , Supploy chain attack , Misconfiguration

# Responding to vulnerabilities , supply chain attack

So if it's your system you need to patch it ASAP , if its the vendor system you need to restrict access to the hosting machine , update IPS and WAF for the attack pattern , apply the temp solutions the vendor recommends

# Responding to Misconfigurations

so those are usually realized after a breach , but a good way to detect them is through penetration testing , regular vulerability scanning , Configuration Audit by going manually through your configuration and check them against the CIS Standards
